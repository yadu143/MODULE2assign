<h1>Top 3 Mobile Games</h1>
	<section class="column-lg-4 colmn-md-6 colmn-sm-12">

			<p class="sub1">Call of Duty: Mobile</p>
			<p class="content">
			 Call of Duty: Mobile is the latest game on this list. We usually wait a while before adding a game, but Call of Duty: Mobile is so intensely popular with such a high rating that we added it more quickly than usual. The game has both a normal FPS online PvP mode along with a 100-player battle royale. That puts it in a rare category where it does battle royale like PUBG Mobile, but also regular FPS PvP like Critical Ops or Modern Combat. There is a surprising amount of stuff to do. It is a free to play game, but most of the in-game purchases are cosmetic items. It still has some bugs, but it’s relatively new so that’s only natural. It’ll get better over time.

			<p class="sub2">Evoland 1 and 2</p>
			<p class="content">Evoland 1 and 2 are two of the most unique Android games. They both use a variety of game mechanics. That includes puzzle, RPG, top-down shooter, classic fighter, trading card, and platformer mechanics. The games pay ode to the proverbial good old days of gaming. Each switch in mechanics also changes the graphics to better suit that part of the game. It’s really a unique experience. Both games also offer hardware controller support, no in-app purchases, no ads, and plenty of story to play through. These are definitely excellent. The publisher, Playdigious, also has Cultist Simulator, OK Golf, Teslagrad, and a couple of other above average (and premium) mobile games.</p>

		<p class="sub3"> Level head </p>
			<p class="content">Levelhead is a new platformer from Butterscotch Shenanigans, the same developer of Crashlands. Crashlands was on this very list for a good two or three years, and we expect Levelhead to be here for a while too. It’s a platformer with 90 levels, surprisingly satisfying controls, and some excellent humor. However, this one sets itself apart from others with its excellent custom level building. Players can build levels and upload them to the game. Other players download them and the most popular end up in the game’s prestigious vault. Plus, the game has speed running features and each level comes with its own leaderboard (even the custom ones). Finally, the game is cross-platform with cloud saves. It covers all of the bases for a mobile platformer. It’s also free with Google Play Pass if you use that. The only other one that comes close is Oddmar, which is excellent in its own right.</p>
